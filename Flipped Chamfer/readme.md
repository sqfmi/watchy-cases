Design Name: Flipped Chamfer

Design License: Open Source 

Design Notes: The primary goal was to create the slimmest design possible for either injection molding or CNC machining.  I designed the case to have two optional bottom parts so that it could be used with either an apple style watch band or a regular watch band.  I'm not a big watch person, so I didn't know what would be most popular. Bottom and top case screw together and the buttons are just floating. This design should be fine to 3D print too, please let me know if you'd like stl files.

Included Files: Several Renders in Aluminum and ABS, Step Files for each design and native Solidworks files.
