# Zoidy case for Watchy – *Incomplete draft.*

*by Rajendra Serber*

I wanted to give some protection to the display while adding the option to embellish the dial. With this design the dial could be left blank, or you could print tick marks for a analog clock,  you could add your favorite artwork, your name, or you could leave out the dial and see the full glory of Watchy underneath the glass.

In thinking about this design I had in mind people who will 3d print or CNC their own case could have fun with mixing and matching colors and materials, and people that get the case from another source could still customize the dial just by printing on paper.

This incomplete draft is still missing binding pins and screws. It's has a ways to go technically and needs some aesthetic refinement. It's more of a design concept at this point; I hope the concept comes across to some degree. It was a valiant attempt at staring the drafting the nite of the deadline.
